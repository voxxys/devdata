The app provides a demonstration of how the shape of the probability density function (pdf) for the Weibull distribution depends on its parameters.

The probability density function of a Weibull random variable is:

$$ f(x;\lambda,k) =
\begin{cases}
\frac{k}{\lambda}\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^{k}} & x\geq0 ,\\
0 & x<0,
\end{cases} $$

* $k$ is the shape parameter
* $\lambda$ is the scale parameter


Parameters $\lambda$ and $k$ can be changed with sliders on the side panel; the probability density function is recalculated and the plot is reactively changed corresponding to the new values.

The following plot shows the Weibull probability distribution function for $\lambda = 1$ and $k = 2$
```{r}
x <- seq(0,5,0.02)
plot(x,dweibull(x,2,1),col="red",type = "l",xlab = "x",ylab = "f(x)",main="Weilbull PDF")
```
